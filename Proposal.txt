150-400 Word Description:

I propose to make a python script which downloads (or preferrably streams) a
YouTube video and displays to your terminal. The project is two-fold: video
retrieval, and image to ascii conversion. The video retrieval process would
likely be handled by a third party module, or through YouTube's API. Some
candidates or references include pafy (https://github.com/np1/pafy), youtube-dl
(https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/),
and PyTube (https://github.com/nficano/pytube). Once the video has been
downloaded, a Python IO library will be used to open the file and iterate
through its image one by one. OpenCV could be used to handle the IO. The
Fabulous library (https://github.com/jart/fabulous) could be used to convert
these images into colored ascii art to be displayed in the terminal.
Alternatively, a custom implementation could be made using OpenCV or PIL for
image processing. A stretch goal of this project would be to use curses or some
key handling system to support pause/play/video search with thumbnails. They key
is that the solution should be entirely portable, and allow for a simple
interface to view videos in a terminal, where no GUI is available.
